# PyWeather App

PyWeather is a weather app in python using OpenWeatherMap's current weather and 3-hour-5-day forecast API services, built using customtkinter to make a modern and elegant GUI to display the weather, and even changes to light/dark mode based on local time of requested city!

It is a personal/school project of mine that I will continue to work on in my free time. It's currently in an experimental stage, and things are subject to change. The planned features for the app (which may or may not be implemented) include a repsonsive GUI, switching to Open Meteo for weather data requests, a weather-map of the local area for precipitation using Mapbox or a similar API, et cetera. Please note, that the app is only designed to work on Windows devices and, as of right now, for those using MacOS or Linux distributionsâ€”Here be dragons!


Example of the app in light mode (day time):

# Instructions for Use

In order to use the app: if you are on Windows, then you can simply download the latest executable (exe) file from the [releases](https://github.com/gravityboots/PyWeather/releases) page; otherwise you must go to the green "Download Code button", and download the zip folder of the code, or simply clone the repository on your computer with git clone. From there extract the zipped folder, and move it to wherever is convenient. Once that is done, you can open the directory in whichever code editor/terminal you are familiar with and run main.py. If you encounter any issues, please create an issue on Github, I will do my best to review them. Contributions will most likely not be given any priority any time soon.

Hopefully you have a great time using the app to find out your local weather and get the upcoming forecast, so you're never caught off-guard!
